# Flask Application: System Health Monitor
# Application Architecture
    # Flask API: Health monitoring dashboard with REST endpoints
    # Redis: Caching metrics and real-time data storage
    # PostgreSQL: Historical health data and alerts storage

# Key Flask Features to Implement
    # Endpoints:
        # GET /health - Current system status
        # GET /metrics - CPU, memory, disk usage
        # GET /alerts - System alerts and thresholds
        # POST /thresholds - Configure monitoring limits

    # Monitoring Components:
        # CPU/Memory usage tracking
        # Disk space monitoring
        # Service availability checks
        # Response time measurements

# Phase 1: Docker
    # Build multi-service app (Flask + Redis + PostgreSQL)
    # Create optimized Dockerfiles with multi-stage builds
    # Configure custom networks and service discovery
    # Deliverables:
        # Flask Health Monitor App with real-time metrics
        # Redis integration for caching live data
        # PostgreSQL setup for historical storage
        # Docker Compose with custom networks
        Network diagram showing service communication

# Phase 2: Kubernetes
    # Migrate app to K8s (Pods, Deployments, Services)
    # Setup ConfigMaps, Secrets, PVCs, HPA
    # Implement RBAC and network policies
    # Deliverables:
        # Complete K8s manifests for all components
        Helm chart for easy deployment
        # RBAC configuration for security
        Network policies for pod communication

# Phase 3: Python DevOps Automation
# Automation Scripts for Health Monitor:

# 1. Health Check Automation (health_checker.py)
#     Monitor app endpoints
#     Auto-restart unhealthy containers
#     Send alerts via webhook/email

# 2. Metrics Collector (metrics_collector.py)
    # Aggregate system metrics
    # Generate performance reports
    Export to monitoring systems (prometheus)

# 3. Backup Automation (backup_manager.py)
#     Automated PostgreSQL backups
    Redis snapshot management

Final Requirements:
Complete end-to-end pipeline demonstrating:
    Containerized Python microservices
    K8s deployment with auto-scaling
    Python automation scripts
    Comprehensive documentation
